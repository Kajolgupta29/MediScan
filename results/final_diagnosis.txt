### Final Diagnosis:

* **Anxiety Disorder**: The patient's history of anxiety, family history of generalized anxiety disorder, and current symptoms of intense chest pain, heart palpitations, and fear of having a heart attack may indicate an underlying anxiety disorder, such as panic disorder, which is supported by both the Cardiologist and Psychologist reports.
* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) with potential respiratory complications**: The patient's GERD could be causing chest pain and shortness of breath, and the Pulmonologist report suggests potential GERD-related respiratory symptoms, making it a possible health issue that requires further evaluation.
* **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy or Mitral Valve Prolapse**: The Cardiologist report suggests that these conditions may not be evident on a routine echocardiogram, but the patient's symptoms, such as chest pain and shortness of breath, could be related to these conditions, and further testing, such as a cardiac MRI, is recommended to rule them out.
